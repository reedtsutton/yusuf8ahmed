### Hi there, I'm Yusuf! 👋

I am a highschool senior with a passion for building software products.

I am the stone that the builder refused. I am the visual, the inspiration
That made Lady sing the blues. I'm the spark that makes your idea bright
The same spark that lights the dark. So that you can know your left from your right
